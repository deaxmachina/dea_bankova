      Being able to animate millions of particles is one of the great capabilities of the WebGL-based Three.js, 
      useful for storytelling with data visualisations, for example. I put together an example of how to use GSAP 
      to animate Three.js-defined particles from one position to another.

      Example patterns of how to use D3â€™s circle packing layout to position elements on Canvas 
      and animate them to a new position with GSAP. Works smoothly even with 10K particles.

      In-dept tutorial with code showing two approaches for combining D3 and React that I have used. 
      In this post, I compare the approaches and explain in detail a couple of examples --bar chart, 
      tooltips, d3-force and d3-brush--, focusing specifically on the option I have tended to prefer, 
      which uses the useEffect and useRef React hooks to hand over DOM access to D3.

      Using more complex SVG shapes as markers in D3 visualisations can be surprisingly simple. 
      In this tutorial, I go over a straightforward way to add SVGs from websites such as flaticon 
      or Font Awesome to a D3 viz. You can extend the same approach to work with shapes 
      you create in Figma, Adobe Illustrator, etc.
