    Hello, and thank you for stopping by. My name is Dea and I am a currently Tokyo-based, and usually 
    London-based, developer and designer focusing on visualisation and visual storytelling through data. 
    I have worked in both industry and academia and have a background in mathematics and machine learning, 
    and a life-long love of art and aesthetics. My goal is to create or contribute to work that engages 
    audiences with the important issues of our day; is creative and informative at the same time; 
    or is fun and delightful.  
  </p>

    I spent just over 3 years in the field of machine learning, both at Microsoft and at a London-based 
    start-up, before moving to Japan and joining the Watanave Lab at the University of Tokyo. There I 
    discovered the world of data visualisation and design, and their use in telling stories, creating 
    archives, and exploring topics in great depth. I realised that data visualisation is a field that 
    combines all my strengths and interests over time, including art, logical thinking, creativity, and 
    storytelling, and decided to switch my focus away from machine learning and towards visualisation.

    I love the end-to-end process of working with data - posing a question, extracting insight, designing 
    the visual representation, and finally coding it all up. My technical stack includes Python for data 
    analysis, JavaScript + React for front-end and D3.js for building visualisations from scratch. I pick 
    up new tools as I go, following whatâ€™s technically required and what I am interested in or believe has 
    the capacity to expand my work. While I truly enjoy the technical process of coding in its own right, 
    ultimately I care about the overall experience/message/purpose of a project more than anything.
