    I am a currently Tokyo-based, and usually London-based, 
    developer and designer focusing on visualisation and visual storytelling through data. My goal is to create or 
    contribute to work that engages audiences with the important issues of our day; is creative and informative 
    at the same time; or is fun and delightful.

    I have worked in both industry and academia, and have a background in mathematics and machine learning. While my 
    focus is on data visualisation, I can engage in the end-to-end process of working with data - 
    posing a question, extracting insight, designing the visual representation, and finally coding it all up. 
    My technical stack includes Python for data analysis, JavaScript and React for front-end, and D3.js for building custom visualisations.
