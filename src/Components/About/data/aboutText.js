  <p>
    I am a London-based developer and designer focusing on visualisation and visual storytelling through data. 
    My goal is to create or contribute to work that engages audiences with the important issues of our day; 
    is creative and informative at the same time; or is fun and delightful.

    I currently work as a Graphics Journalist at Reuters. 
    My past experience spans both industry and academia, and I have a background in mathematics and machine learning. 
    While my focus is on data visualisation, I can engage in the end-to-end process of working with data 
    - posing a question, extracting insight, designing the visual representation, and finally coding it all up. 
    I enjoy trying out and learning new things, and delight in artful and emotionally rich experiences.
