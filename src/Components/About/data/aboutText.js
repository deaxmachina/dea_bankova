    Hello, and thank you for stopping by. My name is Dea and I am a currently Tokyo-based, and usually London-based, 
    developer and designer focusing on visualisation and visual storytelling through data. My goal is to create 
    or contribute to work that engages audiences with the important issues of our day; is creative and informative 
    at the same time; or is fun and delightful. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    While my focus is on data visualisation, I have the skills to engage in the end-to-end process of working 
    with data - posing a question, extracting insight, designing the visual representation, and finally coding 
    it all up. My technical stack includes Python for data analysis, JavaScript and React for front-end and D3.js 
    for building visualisations from scratch. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I have worked in both industry and academia and have a background in mathematics and machine learning, 
    and a life-long love of art and aesthetics. I have also lived in three very culturally different countries 
    and speak multiple languages, which has made me appreciative of varied perspectives and driven me to want to 
    contribute to conveying the unfolding story of our globalised society. 
  </p>
