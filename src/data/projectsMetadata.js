      Think of a big number, the biggest one you can conceive of. Now add 1. You have a bigger number. 
      You can keep going on and on, until you get to infinity. But is this ‘infinity’ an actual destination? 
      What if I told you that an even bigger infinity hides in the numbers just between 0 and 1? 
      The concept of infinity is one of the deepest and most captivating inhabitants of the world of mathematics. 
      But just like with anything else in maths, it can feel distant and unapproachable. 
      This project aims to be a bridge between the everyday curiosity that many of us have about infinity and 
      the rigorous mathematical concept. Starting from the simplest and most relatable infinity - the 
      counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…, and building up all the way to the beautiful Mandelbrot fractal with 
      infinitely zoomable self-similar patterns.
      <br></br><br></br>
      It uses scrollytelling, interactive proofs and mathematical visualisations, together with an approachable 
      and playful visual style. These choices were deliberate. I wanted to convey the sense of awe and wonder 
      that maths has left me with over the years, and create a contrast with the harsh brushstrokes with which 
      this seemingly difficult field is often painted. I went through many style iterations until I settled on 
      the shiny ‘magical girl anime’ aesthetic. The proofs which I included, together with their visual walk-throughs, 
      were chosen to be rigorous, but require little more than curiosity and logic. Plenty of references were included 
      to resources that go into more depth for those who are curious or come from a maths background. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      This piece is a personal passion project by a once maths student turned data visualisation creator, 
      made with the hope to spark joy.

          I made this website as a birthday gift to my wonderful mum, but it also happens to coincide 
          with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of ABBA's iconic Eurovision win in 1974. 
          <br></br>
          Browse through the band’s 9 studio albums, whose songs are represented as a ‘musical constellation’, 
          and visualised though a data art interpretation of musical features and Spotify metrics (energy, danceability, valence, loudness, tempo). 
          The celestial theme reflects on Abba’s journey and the ‘voyage’ theme of their latest album release in 2021. 
          Pro tip: browse through the songs alongside someone and see how much you agree with the values of the 
          Spotify metrics. I find that danceability tends to be particularly contentions.

        Network graphs showing the connections between kanji and radicals they include. 
        My hypothesis was that visualising kanji like this, i.e. using a force graph that 
        naturally nudges kanji which contain similar building blocks together, might help with kanji memorisation. 
        I also used the classification by concept by Wiki dataset to explore patterns between kanji belonging 
        to similar meaning categories and their constituent parts.

        I started this project with the idea of expressing through visualisation 
        the evolution of anime genres over time. Was sci-fi more popular in the 90s, were the 2000s truly the 
        ‘golden age’ of anime, and if so, what genres were prevalent during that time? As is often the case, 
        the story I imagined the data would tell was different to reality.

        Between September 2020 and March 2021, I worked on a project to record the memories of survivors of 
        the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disaster in north Japan. I wanted to find out more about the 
        history of earthquakes in Japan and set out to create this visualisation, where you can see the magnitude 
        and number of casualties over time side by side. 2011 saw the biggest earthquake in recorded Japanese history, 
        but the deadliest one (1923 Kanto) was far smaller in intensity.

        A small tribute to the animanga Attack on Titan – a 3D scene of “the Paths”. 
        Note that I did not optimise this! It works great on an overpowered MacBook, but not so great on an older computer or phone.

        Collection of pages for the World Cup 2022 Reuters real-time coverage, including pages for each team and match, venues, and bracket.
        Match pages, bracket and live match widget on reuters.com updated real time for the duration of the World Cup. 
        I worked on the menus, match cards, live widget, team history, and re-worked an earlier version the bracket visualisation. 
        I also provided real-time support and bug fixes for the duration of the event, and especially during live matches. 
        I split the dev work with a colleague and implemented designs based on designer mock-ups, working collaboratively and iteratively throughout.

    <br></br><br></br>
    This project is a collection of examples and templates for working with Svelte in a number of situations that commonly 
    arise when making D3 graphs, scrollytelling webpages and other kinds of content we often produce.
    <br></br><br></br>
    It is meant to be a continuous work in progress 🛠️ and is by no means an exhaustive, or necessarily a 
    'best practices' 👓 type of collection. All the examples are use cases that I have encountered, 
    built a minimal example around and documented. They come with working code, explained code snippets 
    and notes about the approach taken. ⚠️ They might come with links to the Svelte repl where 
    I originally worked on the example, but these are not always the latest or the best version.

        The aim of this archive project was to document the events and topics surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic in Japan, 
        starting from Jan 2020 and running until Dec 2021, primarily via the use of news headlines. 

        The data is 
        from <a style={{color: "#2B505F"}} className="link-project" target="blank" href="http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/crisis/covid-19/mass-media/">the Covid-19 News Analysis Database</a> by <a style={{color: "#2B505F"}} className="link-project" target="blank"  href="http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/~kitamoto/">Prof Asanobu Kitamoto</a>; articles from Yahoo!

        The objective of this archive-visualisation was to create a virtual space to
        preserve the thoughts, memories and narratives of survivors of 
        the <a a style={{color: "#222E3A"}} className="link-project" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" target="_blank">2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disaster</a>,
        using the content of over 500 interviews. This included people’s 
        movements after 11th March 2011, their messages to their deceased loved ones, the 
        rebuilding of their homes, and their experiences over the past 10 years. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My talented colleague, Dr Takata Yurina created 
        a <a style={{color: "#222E3A"}} className="link-project" href="https://311stories.archiving.jp/" target="_blank">map of the movements</a> of
        people whose homes were destroyed – many of them having to move over 4 times in the past 10 years. 
        The full archive page can be viewed 
        on <a style={{color: "#222E3A"}} className="link-project" href="https://www.iwate-np.co.jp/page/higashinihon2021#01-01" target="_blank">the Iwate Nippo website</a>.

      <p>
        A collaborative project between the Universities 
        of Tokyo and Tsukuba, coordinated by teaching bodies in Japan, with the purpose of producing 
        materials for classroom study prior to school trips to 
        the <a href="https://japan-olympicmuseum.jp/en/" style={{color: "#A62343"}} className="link-project" target="_blank">Olympics Museum in Tokyo</a>.
        The target audience was secondary school students in schools all around Japan. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The questions and accompanying visualisations serve the purpose of cues for group discussions among 
        the students before they visit the museum and aim to bring up important topics around the history 
        and goals of the Olympics and Paralympics. The current iteration is a rough draft, or a PoC to show 
        what is possible through the use of interactive visualisations. 
        The Japanese version can be found <a href="https://olympicsjp.netlify.app/" style={{color: "#A62343"}} className="link-project" target="_blank">here</a>.
